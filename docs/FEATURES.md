## Ping

The `ping` command is a utility feature that measures the latency or response time of the bot. It's a handy way to check if the bot is actively online and its uptime.

## Prompt

The `prompt` command allows staff members to have the bot ask questions in the specified channel. This is a great way to encourage discussions among community members or gather their opinions on a specific question/topic.

## Purge

The `purge` command allows designated users to have the bot mass-delete messages from a channel. We use this command to clean up after "spam attacks".

## Say

The `say` command functions as a message relay tool, allowing designated users to share information, or make announcements. When users trigger the say command followed by a text input, the bot will post the provided message in the specified channel. It's particularly useful in cases where staff members want to share a message on behalf of the CSS team.

## Whereis

The `whereis` command allows students to find the location of a building on campus by getting a campus map with the building highlighted.

## Year

The `year` command enables users to assign themselves a role that indicates their current academic year.
